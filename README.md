### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Amaury Loubry

I'm a certified Unity Programmer in C# looking to get professional experience to start my career as a freelancer.

I started using Unity in November 2020, working on small projects to learn by myself. In 2022 I followed a 6 month course for Unity and C#, and I recently passed the exam to become a Certified Unity Associate Programmer.

Outside of work, my hobbies and interests include: cooking, traveling, music production, and board/video gaming.
